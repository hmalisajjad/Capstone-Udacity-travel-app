Basically In this project I use three different api's (geonames, weatherbit, and Pixabay). from these api's I get destination name, langitude, latitude and picture. First I get help from my last two projects.

I got basic code from my last two projects and add api's in this project.

I make changes according to the requirement. like

Create main folder travel app project

add src folder

then add Client and server folder in src folder

then in client folder add js, css, views folder and index.js file.

I have successfully run these command:

npm run build-prod

npm run build-dev

npm run start

I implement all the required tool in it which I learned from previous projects.
